# Peltast

Peltast is my own starter script for building static sites. I thought it might be worth sharing.

It's a standard Markdown/YAML/Jinja setup with Tailwind and BrowserSync added for easy development.

The point is to have something stripped down but very functional. It's better than writing straight HTML/CSS, but just barely.
